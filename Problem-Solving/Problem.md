## Best Way to Improve Problem Solving
The best way to improve your problem solving ability is by building experience by making lots and lots of programs. The more practice you have the better you’ll be prepared to solve real world problems.

It is a good strategy to use the following steps in the problem solving process.

## Steps to Solve the Problem

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
To gain clarity and understanding of the problem, write it down on paper, reword it in plain English until it makes sense to you, and draw diagrams if that helps. When you can explain the problem to someone else in plain English, you understand it.

If you don’t understand the problem, you won’t know when you’ve successfully solved it

### Step 2: Plan
- **Sketch User Interface**: Does your program have a user interface, what will it look like and what functionality will it have?
- **Inputs**: What inputs your program has and the source of those inputs.
- **Output**: What are the desired outputs?
- **Between Inputs and Outputs**: What are the necessary steps? Write out an algorithm to solve the problem.

### Step 3: Pseudocode
Pseudocode is writing out the logic for your program in natural language instead of code. 

Example:

```Bash
When the user inputs a number
Initialize a counter variable and set its value to zero
While counter is smaller than user inputted number increment the counter by one
Print the value of the counter variable
```

### Steps 4: Divide and Conquer
Break the big problem down and solve each of the smaller problems until you’ve solved the big problem.

Each of the steps in the algorithm we wrote out in the last section are subproblems.

Getting started with and solving one of the subproblems you have identified in the planning stage often reveals the next subproblem you can work on, so it is okay if the initial algorithm is incomplete.

Don't try to solve the problem in one go. If the problem is sufficiently complex, you’ll get yourself tied in knots. Decomposing problems is a better strategy.
